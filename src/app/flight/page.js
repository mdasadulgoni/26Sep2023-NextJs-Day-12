            <p>
            In 2007, the Government of India announced the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. However, while the “Indian” branding was replaced with the Air India brand in the public eye, the “IC” and “IAC” codes of IATA and ICAO respectively, and callsign “INDAIR” continued to be used on domestic flights and international flights that were operated by Airbus A320 family aircraft until 26 February 2011, when Indian Airlines ceased operating under its own brand and codes and completed its merger with Air India.[8]

            The last plane to bear the Indian Airlines livery, an Airbus A319 registered as VT-SCF was repainted in the Air India livery in 2018
